Crushlists

A small site where students can put up their crushlists.  This will eventually be password protected.

Students will enter people they have crushes on, and then can view who they or other people have crushes on, as well as who has crushes on a given person.


THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO FIX/ADD/CHANGE
<ul>
<li>add a list of most frequently listed crushes (people who lots of people like)</li>
<li>have a separate category for honorable mentions, adding similar to the crushes</li>
<li>upload pictures of crushlists?</li>
<li>edit the search function to make it more accessible</li>
<li>chains of crushes, etc -- (my dad started working on this for fun so if someone wants to do this, bug him for his code)</li>
</ul>
